## GitHub Actions Usage

This repository provides GitHub Actions for managing Solana program deployments and verification.
It is highly recommended to use the squads integration for program deployments.

### Features

- ✅ Automated program builds
- ✅ Program verification against source code
- ✅ IDL buffer creation and uploads
- ✅ Squads multisig integration
- ✅ Program deploys for both devnet and mainnet
- ✅ Compute budget optimization
- ✅ Retry mechanisms for RPC failures

### How to use

The easiest way to use the github actions is using one of the [reusable workflows](https://github.com/solana-developers/github-workflows).
You can also follow this [Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/h-ngRgWW_IM)

There are three examples:

- [Anchor Program](https://github.com/Woody4618/anchor-github-action-example)
- [Native Program](https://github.com/Woody4618/native-solana-github-action-example)
- [Anchor Program using Squads](https://github.com/Woody4618/workflow-tutorial) 

### Required Secrets for specific actions

Some of the actions of the build workflow require you to add secrets to your repository:

```bash
# Network RPC URLs
DEVNET_SOLANA_DEPLOY_URL=   # Your devnet RPC URL - Recommended to use a payed RPC url
MAINNET_SOLANA_DEPLOY_URL=  # Your mainnet RPC URL - Recommended to use a payed RPC url

# Deployment Keys
DEVNET_DEPLOYER_KEYPAIR=    # Base58 encoded keypair for devnet
MAINNET_DEPLOYER_KEYPAIR=   # Base58 encoded keypair for mainnet

PROGRAM_ADDRESS_KEYPAIR=    # Keypair of the program address - Needed for initial deploy and for native programs to find the program address. Can also be overwritten in the workflow if you dont have the keypair.

# For Squads integration
MAINNET_MULTISIG=          # Mainnet Squads multisig address
MAINNET_MULTISIG_VAULT=    # Mainnet Squads vault address
```

Customize the workflow to your needs!

## Key Actions

### Setup & Configuration

- `setup-all`: Comprehensive development environment setup

  - Installs and configures Solana CLI tools
  - Sets up Anchor framework (if needed)
  - Installs solana-verify for build verification
  - Configures Node.js environment
  - Handles caching for faster subsequent runs
  - Inputs:
    - `solana_version`: Solana version to install
    - `anchor_version`: Anchor version to install
    - `verify_version`: solana-verify version to install
    - `node_version`: Node.js version to install

- `extract-versions`: Automatically detects required versions
  - Extracts Solana version from Cargo.lock
  - Detects Anchor version from Anchor.toml or Cargo.lock
  - Provides fallback versions if not found
  - Outputs:
    - `solana_version`: Detected Solana version
    - `anchor_version`: Detected Anchor version

### Build & Verification

- `build-verified`: Builds program with verification support
  - Uses solana-verify for reproducible builds
  - Supports both native and Anchor programs
  - Handles feature flags and conditional compilation
  - Inputs:
    - `program`: Program name to build
    - `features`: Optional Cargo features to enable

### Deployment

- `write-program-buffer`: Writes a buffer that will then later be set either from the provided keypair or from the squads multisig

  - Creates buffer for program deployment
  - Set the buffer authority either to the provided keypair or to the squads multisig
  - Supports priority fees for faster transactions
  - Inputs:
    - `program-id`: Target program ID
    - `program`: Program name
    - `rpc-url`: Solana RPC endpoint
    - `keypair`: Deployer keypair
    - `buffer-authority-address`: Authority for the buffer
    - `priority-fee`: Transaction priority fee

- `write-idl-buffer`: Writes an Anchor IDL buffer that will then later be set either from the provided keypair or from the squads multisig
  - Creates IDL buffer
  - Sets up IDL authority
  - Prepares for IDL updates
  - Inputs:
    - `program-id`: Program ID
    - `program`: Program name
    - `rpc-url`: Solana RPC endpoint
    - `keypair`: Deployer keypair
    - `idl-authority`: Authority for IDL updates

### Additional Actions

- `build-anchor`: Specialized Anchor program builder
- `program-upgrade`: Handles the exteding of the program account in case the program is getting bigger and either sets the buffer or skips that in case of squads deploy
- `idl-upload`: Either sets the IDL buffer or skips that in case of squads deploy
- `verify-build`: Verifies on-chain programs match source using solana-verify andthe osec api

# Close Buffer in case of failure

There may the occasions where the release flow fails in between writing the program buffer and the program deploy in squads.
In that case you may want to close a buffer that was already transferred authority to your multisig.
You can do that using the following command:

```bash
solana program show --buffers --buffer-authority <You multisig vault address>

npx ts-node scripts/squad-closebuffer.ts \
 --rpc "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" \
 --multisig "FJviNjW3L2u2kR4TPxzUNpfe2ZjrULCRhQwWEu3LGzny" \
 --buffer "7SGJSG8aoZj39NeAkZvbUvsPDMRcUUrhRhPzgzKv7743" \
 --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json \
 --program "BhV84MZrRnEvtWLdWMRJGJr1GbusxfVMHAwc3pq92g4z"
```
